            Hello! My name is Kyle Schemmel. I am a software developer and free software enthusiast from the Midwestern United States. I hold a Computer Science degree from the University of Michigan.
            <br/><br/>
            I have 5+ years of industry experience, covering backend and frontend development as well as system administration and DevOps. I have seen through entire products from start to finish, across a number of languages in multiple sectors.
            <br/><br/>
            Beyond product creation, I maintain a side project preparing and selling "liberated" computersâ€”machines with all but the lowest level of nonfree software components removed.
            <br/><br/>
            On this website, I promote projects I am currently working on, and showcase older undertakings which I am proud of.
            <br/><br/>
            Would you like to hire me? Please visit my <Link href="/contact">contact page</Link> for information on getting ahold of me.
